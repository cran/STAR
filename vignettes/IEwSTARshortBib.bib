	abstract = {Suppose that a neuron is firing spontaneously or that it is firing
	under the influence of other neurons. Suppose that the data available
	are the firing times of the neurons present. An "integrate several
	inputs and fire" model is developed and studied empirically. For
	the model a neuron's firing occurs when an internal state variable
	crosses a random threshold. This conceptual model leads to maximum
	likelihood estimates of internal quantities, such as the postsynaptic
	potentials of the measured influencing neurons, the membrane potential,
	the absolute threshold and also estimates of derived quantities such
	as the strength-duration curve and the recovery process of the threshold.
	The model's validity is examined via an estimate of the conditional
	firing probability. The approach appears useful for estimating biologically
	meaningful parameters, for examining hypotheses re these parameters,
	for understanding the connections present in neural networks and
	for aiding description and classification of neurons and synapses.
	Analyses are presented for a number of data sets collected for the
	sea hare, Aplysia californica, by J. P. Segundo. Both excitatory
	and inhibitory examples are provided. The computations were carried
	out via the Glim statistical package. An example of a Glim program
	realizing the work is presented in the Appendix.},

	The mathematical tool for describing sequences of events occurring

	We review the basic techniques for analyzing single-neuron discharge
	patterns and describe what they reveal about the underlying point
	process model. By applying information theory and estimation theory
	to point processes, we describe the fundamental limits on how well
	information can be represented by and extracted from neural discharges.
	We illustrate applying these results by considering recordings from
